# HEROIC: a platform for remote collection of electroencephalographic data using consumer-grade brain wearables

## Software Setup
* See `setup_instructions.md` for walkthrough of software installation steps
* Launch the EEG Software: with HEROIC/HEROIC-core/`launch_HEROIC.bat`
* Prepare EEG headband 
* See `HEROIC_Participant_Instructions.pdf` for instructions for study participants
  
## Use GUI to guide users through device setup

Integrates delivery of experiments and different data capture streams:
* __Low-cost electroencephalogram (EEG):__ 4-channel Muse 2 and Muse S

## Customize the data collection to suit your experiments
Our pilot study was done using 
- resting state eyes open
- resting state eyes closed
- visual oddball tasks
But we also include examples of how you can continue to implement new tasks like:
- The stroop task
- Auditory oddball
